      I am an international student from Vietnam. I came here with a Bachelors
      in Computer Science from a university in Vietnam. But in the United States
      I had to start over. It was a culture shock. At the time I didn’t think I
      was financially, physically, or mentally capable of finishing school again
      on the other side of the world. A few years of hard work and studying paid
      off though, I graduated and with an internship that led to a full time
      job.


      I was a straight-A student in college before I began working as a
      front-end engineer, but the company didn't do well. So after leaving there
      I went to LSUS with a Foundation scholarship to work on my Bachelor degree
      full time. During this time I helped manage my family’s businesses and
      also worked as a contract developer for Horntoad Studios LLC.


      September of 2014 my son was born and I chose to stay at home to make sure
      he was well cared for and I also put full support in my husband. Now my
      son is ready to go into 1st grade and I feel ready to go back into the
      work force. While I haven't worked professionally since my son's birth, I
      am a fast learner and hard worker which has allowed me to accomplish
      everything placed before me so far. I believe that if we're willing to
      learn and start over we can all be successful, no matter who or where we
      are.
