I am an international student from Vietnam. I came here with a Bachelors in Computer Science from a university in Vietnam. But in the United States I had to start over. It was a culture shock. At the time I didn’t think I was financially, physically, or mentally capable of finishing school again on the other side of the world. A few years of hard work and studying paid off though, I graduated and with an internship that led to a full time job.

I met my husband around the same time I graduated and we were married. During that time I grew as an engineer and learned that I had a passion for working on the user experience and front-end for web development. After a few years of working and marriage we decided to have a child and I decided to work from home with my son as a contractor, continuing web development focused on the front-end and design. During this time I also focused a lot of time providing my son with the best care.

It’s been six years since then and I’m ready to go back to work full time. I went to Lambda school to refresh my skills and prepare myself for the workforce. This reinforced my passion for user experience design as I worked to try and improve every design I was able to touch. I’ve always been a creative person, I like to draw, paint, build, and plan. This translated directly into my front-end work as I liked to work with the design. Fine tuning and adapting it to the use case as well as work on making it transition to mobile smoothly.

In addition to software development I also enjoy working as a Vietnamese-English interpreter. I’ve built a lot of good customer relationships working as an interpreter and I enjoy being able to use my native language to help bridge the gap between two cultures. I also enjoy spending time with my family, going out for hikes or road trips and seeing any sights that I can take in.
